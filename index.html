<p>The pandemic was a hard time for many of us. In that time, many were laid off from work or pushed to do their jobs remotely. At the time I worked at Outback Steakhouse, where I went from serving tables in the dining room to serving the community through to go food. At some point, I did fall ill with Covid 19, but I took that time off work to relax. I also picked up a few new skills throughout my time at home, I taught myself how to sew and how to solvce a Rubik's cube.
